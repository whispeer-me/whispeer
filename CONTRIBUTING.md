You can send us an email at <hey@whispeer.me>

## Reporting Security Issues

We take  security seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue,
instead send your report privately to us via [email](mailto:hey@whispeer.me?subject=Security%20Issue).
This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that _are_ found
can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)
to any affected parties.

## Reporting Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of the web browser you're using
* Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
* The full output of any console errors or stack traces
* A code snippet or a link to a repository that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* The version of Node.js and any relevant frameworks (like Vue.js) you are using
* Any relevant screenshots or screen recordings
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem, such as specific user interactions or network requests

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.

## Opening Pull Requests

We respect the contributors' labor more than anything, so, we would like to confirm your contributions are made by the true person through your public GPG Key that validates your full name and email address.

**Pull Requests will be merged only after they are signed with valid GPG signatures from the author.**
